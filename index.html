    <h2 style="color:#183153;">Why he is my GOAT</h2>
    <p>
        Hirohiko Araki is my GOAT becuase his work on <span style="color:#7e2f8e;">"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure"</span>
        has redefined what manga can be-blending bold, fashion-inspired art, inventive powers, and multi-generational storytelling
        that stays fresh even after decades. His characters' iconic poses and outfits are heavily influenced by high fashion, leading
        to collaborations with brands like Gucci and Coach, where he's merged manga with runway aesthetics in ways no one else has.
        Araki's style is so distinct that it has crossed into unexpected realms, from luxury clothing to food product partnerships,
        proving his influence extends far beyond comics. On top of that, his love for Western music shines through in his naming of
        characters, powers, and story arcs after famous songs, ablums, and artists, giving his work a unique cultural flavor that blends
        visual art with musical heritage. Perhaps most impressively, Araki broke away from shonen norms by creating falmboyant, fasionable,
        and emotionally complex male characters at a time when the genre favored simpler, cookie-cutter designs-proving that orininality and style
        could coexist with strong storytelling. He doesn't just make manga-he creates cultural phenomena that bridge art, fashion, music, and pop culture.

    <h2 style="color:#0d567a;">Career Highlights</h2>
    <p>
        Araki began drawing manga at a young age, influenced by both Japanese and Western art. 
        In 1987, he launched JoJo's Bizarre Adventure in Weekly Shōnen Jump. 
        The series is divided into multiple parts, each following a different protagonist 
        from the Joestar family. Its mix of action, supernatural elements, and eccentric fashion 
        set it apart from other works in the genre.
    </p>
    <p>
        Araki’s distinctive art style has evolved over the decades, moving from muscular 
        character designs to more slender, fashion-inspired figures. His love of classical 
        art, music, and Western culture is reflected in the series’ character poses, names, 
        and settings.
