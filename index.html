    <h2 style="color:#0d567a;">Career Highlights</h2>
    <p>
        Araki began drawing manga at a young age, influenced by both Japanese and Western art. 
        In 1987, he launched JoJo's Bizarre Adventure in Weekly Shōnen Jump. 
        The series is divided into multiple parts, each following a different protagonist 
        from the Joestar family. Its mix of action, supernatural elements, and eccentric fashion 
        set it apart from other works in the genre.
    </p>
    <p>
        Araki’s distinctive art style has evolved over the decades, moving from muscular 
        character designs to more slender, fashion-inspired figures. His love of classical 
        art, music, and Western culture is reflected in the series’ character poses, names, 
        and settings.
