    <h2>Career Highlights</h2>
    <p>
        Araki began drawing manga at a young age, influenced by both Japanese and Western art. 
        In 1987, he launched JoJo's Bizarre Adventure in Weekly Shōnen Jump. 
        The series is divided into multiple parts, each following a different protagonist 
        from the Joestar family. Its mix of action, supernatural elements, and eccentric fashion 
        set it apart from other works in the genre.

        Araki’s distinctive art style has evolved over the decades, moving from muscular 
        character designs to more slender, fashion-inspired figures. His love of classical 
        art, music, and Western culture is reflected in the series’ character poses, names, 
        and settings.
